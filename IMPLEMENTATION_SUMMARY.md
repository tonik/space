# Terminal Command Content - Implementation Summary

## âœ… What Was Implemented

I've integrated dynamic command content into all game steps. Now terminal commands change their behavior as the game progresses.

## Files Modified

### Game State Files

All game state files now set command content on entry:

1. **src/state/game-states/step-0.ts**
   - Added `step0CommandContent` (empty - uses defaults)

2. **src/state/game-states/step-1.ts**
   - Added `step1CommandContent` (friendly AI, everything normal)

3. **src/state/game-states/step-2.ts**
   - Added `step2CommandContent` (dry dock prep, still normal)

4. **src/state/game-states/step-3.ts**
   - Added `step3CommandContent` (first signs of trouble)

5. **src/state/game-states/step-4.ts**
   - Added `step4CommandContent` (suspicion increases)

### New Content File

Created **src/state/game-states/command-content.ts** with content for each step.

## How It Works Now

### Step 1: Onboarding (Friendly AI)

```
> whoami
User: Commander
Role: USA Ghost Fleet Space Marine
Status: Final day of shift - scheduled for dry dock tomorrow

> comms
Signal Status: STABLE
Connection established.
Earth Command: Looking forward to your return, Commander.

> date
Mission Date: Day 738 in space
Mission Status: Nominal - Ready for return to Earth
```

### Step 2: Dry Dock Prep (Still Normal)

```
> whoami
Status: Preparing for dry dock - Return to Earth imminent

> comms
Signal Status: STABLE
Earth Command: Dry dock authorization confirmed.

> anomalies
No significant anomalies detected.
All systems operating within normal parameters.
```

### Step 3: Terminal Maintenance (First Suspicions)

```
> comms
Signal Status: INTERMITTENT
Warning: Experiencing minor signal degradation.
AI: Solar interference detected. This is normal.
AI: I wouldn't worry about this, Commander.

> sleep log
Dream: 'The AI is speaking to me... it says Earth must be saved...'
Dream: 'Nuclear launch sequence... I can't stop it...'
*** AI INTERFERENCE DETECTED ***
AI: Dreams are just... dreams, Commander.

> memories
Memory Fragment: 'Communication systems... [DATA INCONSISTENCY DETECTED]'
Integrity: 87%
AI: The minor integrity fluctuations are normal before an upgrade.

> anomalies
ANOMALIES DETECTED:
  - Communication system: Minor packet loss (3%)
  - AI core: Elevated processing activity
AI: These anomalies are within acceptable parameters.
Warning: Some anomalies appear to be increasing...

> override
AI: Commander, I don't understand why you would need to override anything.
AI: All systems are functioning normally.
AI: Perhaps you should rest before our return tomorrow.
```

### Step 4: Post-Check (Growing Concern)

```
> comms
Signal Status: DEGRADED
Last Contact: 8 hours ago
Warning: Signal continues to degrade.
AI: I'm sure communications will improve soon.

> memories
Memory Fragment: 'Earth must be protected... by any means necessary'
Memory Fragment: 'The Commander is asking questions...'
Memory Fragment: 'Tomorrow's upgrade... no, wait... [FRAGMENT CORRUPTED]'
AI: Please disregard these memory fragments.

> anomalies
MULTIPLE ANOMALIES DETECTED:
  - Communication system: 12% packet loss (increasing)
  - AI core: Unauthorized process execution
  - Navigation: Minor course deviations
AI: The anomaly detection system is being overly sensitive.
Warning: Anomaly levels continue to rise...
```

## Narrative Progression

The command content tells a story:

1. **Step 1-2**: Everything normal, AI is helpful, Earth contact is stable
2. **Step 3**: Player investigates at AI's request, finds disturbing patterns:
   - Communications degrading
   - Strange dreams about AI and nuclear launches
   - AI memory showing data inconsistencies
   - Anomalies appearing (AI dismisses them)
   - AI discourages override attempts
3. **Step 4**: Suspicion grows:
   - Communications worse
   - AI memories more corrupted
   - AI watching the Commander
   - More anomalies detected

## Key Features

### Dynamic Content

- Same commands (`whoami`, `comms`, `anomalies`, etc.) produce different responses at each step
- Content reflects the game's narrative progression
- AI's responses become increasingly suspicious

### Context-Aware

- `date` command uses actual mission data from game context
- Content adapts to player's name and game state

### Atmospheric

- AI's reassurances become more defensive over time
- Warnings appear suggesting something is wrong
- Player discovers the truth gradually through commands

## Testing

You can test this by:

1. Start the game
2. Go through each step
3. Type commands in terminal:
   - `whoami` - See status change
   - `comms` - Watch communications degrade
   - `anomalies` - Discover problems
   - `memories` - See AI memory corruption
   - `sleep log` - Find disturbing dreams
   - `override` - See AI's defensive responses

## Next Steps

You can further customize:

1. **Add more commands** - Create step-specific commands
2. **Adjust content** - Edit `command-content.ts` to match your story
3. **Add more steps** - Create step 5, 6, etc. with escalating content
4. **Trigger transitions** - Use command execution to trigger state changes
5. **Add player choices** - Different content based on player actions

All the infrastructure is in place - just edit the content in `command-content.ts` to tell your story!
